Video Capture Initialization:
video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0): Initializes the webcam (camera index 0) for capturing video frames.

Main Loop:
The while True loop continuously captures frames from the webcam.
ret, frames = video_capture.read(): Reads the next video frame. ret indicates whether the frame was successfully read, and frames contains the image data.

Preprocessing:
gray = cv2.cvtColor(frames, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY): Converts the color image to grayscale. Face detection often works better with grayscale images.

Face Detection:
faces = faceCascade.detectMultiScale(...): Detects faces in the grayscale frame.
faceCascade is assumed to be a pre-trained face detection classifier (e.g., Haar Cascade).
Parameters like scaleFactor, minNeighbors, and minSize control the face detection process.
Detected faces are stored in the faces variable as rectangles (x, y, width, height).

Drawing Rectangles:
A green rectangle is drawn around each detected face using cv2.rectangle(...).
The (x, y) coordinates specify the top-left corner, and (x+w, y+h) specify the bottom-right corner of the rectangle.

Displaying the Result:
cv2.imshow('Video', frames): Displays the frame with rectangles around detected faces.
Press ‘q’ to exit the video stream.

Cleanup:
video_capture.release(): Releases the webcam.
cv2.destroyAllWindows(): Closes all OpenCV windows.
