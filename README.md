Face Recognition with OpenCV
Overview
This project captures real-time video from the webcam, detects faces, and draws rectangles around them. It serves as a basic face recognition system using OpenCV.

Features
Real-time face detection
Simple rectangle visualization around detected faces
Press ‘q’ to exit the video stream

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (install via pip install opencv-python)

Usage
Clone this repository.
Run the script: python face_recognition.py
Observe the video stream with face detection.

Future Enhancements
Integrate face recognition models for identification.
Improve accuracy and performance.
